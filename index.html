		  <h2>The Internet v World Wide Web</h2>
		  <p class="a">Before learning about the history of the www, it is important to know that the internet and www are both different as many people seem to think they’re the same, but they are not. The internet is series of huge computer networks that allows computers to connect and communicate with others globally. Both the internet and www use different protocols to work. The internet using IMAP, POP3 and SMPT while the www uses protocols such as HTML (Hypertext markup language) HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and URLS(Uniform resource locator).</p>

		  <h2>The Beginning of the WWW</h2>
		  <p class="a">Ideas for the www date all the way back to the 1940s but the 1980s is when the ideas started to become a reality. The man who created the www was Tim Berners Lee was a physicist who wanted to share information with other physicists around the world. In 1989 set about putting together a proposal together for a centralized database which contained links to other documents. This system had different names such as TIM(The Information Mine) but in the end became what we know today as the world wide web. In late 1990, Berners Lee developed three major components for the web which were HTTP, HTML and the first web browser. On August 6th 1991, the world’s first web page was launched.</p>

			<h2>Javascript and CSS</h2>
			<p class="a">When the www started, web pages were only text documents but today they are much more. Today’s web page would not be what they are without the creation of Javascript and css. Javascript helped the web become more dynamic and interactive while css helped introduce the style and look of the web. All the fading text you see here when scrolling down is caused by a javascript.</p>
